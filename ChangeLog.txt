Original Mod Changelog
Mission Controller 3.1.3.0

1. Fixed an Issue with Frequencies not updated in flight, without reloading flight scene.
2. Changed Satellite Contracts to completely use Default KSP Orbits + Orbit checks.. This results in much more variety and accuracy in readings. Also, should make all satellite contracts 100% fool proof in Types of orbits. Meaning 100% compatible with any type of mod planets or Increased size of the game world.
3. Added the ability for all satellite contracts to have a % chance to be launched to another Body other than Kerbin.  You must first visit other Planetary bodies (IE Discover) before contracts will be able to be sent.. IE Mun,Minmus,Duna etc.  Only Kerbin based Contracts will have ground stations though.  
2. Changed Orbital Research Orbits same as satellite. Same reason.
3. All these changes has made the average Orbital Height much higher for all missions. Making them a little more difficult. Increased payout of Contracts to compensate for this.
4. Added new ModuleManger .cfg patch file that was made by KnotaiG.  Now all probes including modded ones will have MCESatelliteCore added to them. Allowing
all of them to be used as MCE Probes.

Mission Controller 3.1.2.0
1. Added ability to change Probe MCE settings in flight.  Its strange but only easy fix I could find to allow other mods like Hangar mod + Extra-planetary launch pads to be able to launch MCE probes.  The probe can only still be used once though.. So once you transmit you contract settings, the probe settings is no longer under your control.
2. Up the Contract Payout multiplier from 3X to a max of 10X.  This should allow for better payouts for larger type worlds with bigger planets.  For instance a Navigation contract at KSP default size at 10X low orbits now pay about 600K.. So should be enough to compensate.
3. Fixed Revert cost not showing.  At some point I did a quick fix on this that I forgot about that disabled it.  So now revert cost again are % of total ship cost + fuel.  you can set the Multiplier for this in In game settings.. Default is 10% of cost of the vessel to Revert.
4. Fixed Issues with Repair Contract Payouts. They should be much better payouts at higher orbits now.

Mission Controller 3.1.1.0

1. Added First Stages of A Manual To KSP you can find it in the Mission Controller Folder called "Mission Controller Manual"  This is first stage of maybe adding
in game manual.  If someone wants to help with this it be great!  Added Directions for How To Do Mission Controller Satellite Contracts, How To Change Module + Satellie + Frequencies in VAB for Satellite Contracts and how to Finish Mission Controller Satellite Contracts in Game!  More to come soon.

2. Redid the UI for Changing Module Types, Satellite Types when Doing Mission Controller Satellite Contracts.  Much easier now to select and read what your chaning when selecting Satellite Types and Module Type in the VAB when Setting up for these types of contracts!  Module and Satellite types are now Push Buttons when you right click on any Non Manned Probes.  All probes are in vanilla game are Populated with Mission Controller Modules using Module Manager.  You can add your own Modded probes via Module Manage by using the "MCESatelliteCore".  Example located in MCEProbePatch.cfg in Parts Menu of Mission Controller.

2.Fixed an Apollo-Duna fail load on TargetBody4.
3.Fixed KEOSync Orbits for Satellite network contract. Should have the right values now.
4.Fixed Rover Waypoint Drive Contract showing up multiple times in contract list.


version 1.3.6 For KSP 1.11
1. Fixed issue with some more errors in Contract Save and Load configs.
2. Fixed issue with lower res games having issues with GUI Screens. (hopefully).

[b]Version 1.3.4 (KSP 1.1 Update)[/b]

1.Fixed the issues with APA and PEA in most contracts I hope. 
2.Only the Satellite Network Contracts have a set value for KEOSync orbits now.. All other contracts can have random values to help spice it up a little. 
3.Messed a little with the randomness of Repair Contracts. 
4.Worded some of the missions a little different.

11. .fixed an issue with Repair contracts and a possible NRE when the Check for Repair Part doesn't pass.
12. .fixed issues Up to and including all Apollo Historic missions I could find. I still have more work to do on finding any issues with the later historic missions.
13. .Searched for in code errors that have been around and trying to squash them. These don't cause many problems in game but might help reduce More NRE issues.
14. Added new contract Land Rover, and Drive Rover.  This is a WIP project and might not work totally correctly yet.  But the mission has two parts, Land your rover on (Duna is only planet this release) specific waypoint.  The waypoint is represented in the Map view during the game.  You do have a small margin or error for the LZ.  But you have to be pretty close when landing the rover.  The next part is a 2nd contract that adds a new waypoint for you to drive your rover to.  This one is pretty self explanatory.  Again this contract is a WIP.  I have not had much time to test it out and any possible issues.  I will continue to work on it as I get time though.
15. Added Mini AVC to Mission Controller to help control possible version conflicts.


[B]version 1.26[/B] 
Fixed issue where Repair Contracts not showing. Had to get rid of the ability to choose your own Chance percentage in config file.  This is a quick fix to get them to show up again until I can look into changing this later.

[B]Version 1.25[/B]

1. Fixed the Great potatoes Bug mystery.  Satellite contracts had a strange requirement for a Potato?  This was not an intentional feature.  What happened was that I have always used a default mission objective from default KSP contracts.  That is the satellite has Power and is new.. This was from the fineprint contracts that ship with the game now.  When 1.05 for KSP came out the contract. Parameters for fine print were MOVED to a new location and some renamed.  I found what I though was the new name for Satellite has power and is new.. But I guess it is not the case.  Sorry for lack of checking on that one, that part is my fault.

2. I  raised the default error of margin for APA and PEA from 1000 to 5000.

3. Shipped the up-to-date config file with new version.  The older version had an older config file.. Was not a big deal the config file rewrites itself if its not correct, but still rather have the right one for you can edit the config file before starting for the first time.


[B]Version 1.24[/B]
1.05 compatible changed a few things that made MC2 not work right in 1.05 of KSP.  All should be good now.

[B]Version 1.22[/B]

1.Fixed the Issue with Low and High Frequencies not being able to be selected.
2.Added a Margin Of Error for Low and High APA values in config file.
3.Added Payment Modifier in the Config File for contracts.
4.Satellite Contracts should no longer have random parts for Mission Controller.

[B]Version 1.2 Released[/B]
1. Completely redid satellite contracts. Satellite contracts now require new parts! They are also very different and use Frequencies to communicate with ground stations to complete contracts. Most missions require KeoStation Orbit and to keep target ground stations in line of sight at all times.
2. Single delivery Contract Missions.
3. Network Contracts: Construct a 6 satellite network above kerbin. This is the big daddy contract of MCE. Pays well, but takes time and knowledge to complete.
4. Lots of code clean up no more Kerbal Insurance. (out of scope for this mod now)
5. Brand new Parts for satellite contracts. Communication Core, Navigation Core, Weather Core, and Research Core. Check the forum page for info on new contracts and how to complete them. In game explanation is also pretty thorough if you don't like to read. LOL.

[B]Version 1.21 Released[/B]
1. Fixed the duplication bug of Historical Contracts.  Only 1 should show up now in your contract list.

[B]Version 1.12.3 [/B]

1.  All part textures converted to DDS format.
2. Fixed Apollo-Duna Orbital Mission Transmit Science from ground.  Suppose to be transmit science from Space.
3. Fixed payout for Apollo-Duna Orbital Mission.  Was way to much.
4. Fixed Apollo-Duna payout for Build Station.  Was way to much.
5. Other small fixes forgot about.

With this update make sure to delete your Old MissionControllerEC folder completely.  Or you will get duplicate part textures!  DDS and PNG.  Bad idea.
[B]Version 1.12.2[/B]

1. Removed the need for any future RSS config files. Mission Controller 2 will figure out the Orbits of all bodies on its own.. (I hope)
2. Removed Civilian Contracts.
3. Fixed Repair Contracts. The contracts no longer have SpareParts as requirement. (forgot to remove last time)
4. Fixed Repair Contracts. The descriptions for the contracts now should read new method for Repairs.
5. Did a small pass on some of the contract payouts. This might take awhile as I get a look at what contracts are paying and bring more changes.
6. Removed some other legacy code no longer used.
7. Added Supplies From USI Life support to the Custom Resupply Contract.

ChangLog 1.12.1

1. KSP 1.0 Version compatible.
2. No more hire Cost (1.0 has it)
3. Civilian Contracts Turned off (possibly removed next version since 1.0 has civ contracts)
4. No more in editor Parts reader (1.0 has some sort of System)
5. No more dependencies. (you only need mission controller now to run MC).
6. Another Revamp of Repair Missions. No longer require SpareParts or any type of resource. All you need now is a Kerbal Engineer to fix satellites. Or stations.
7. Added Apollo 17 (Minmus)
8. Added new expanded Apollo Missions with 9 new single contracts covering the Set up and landing on Duna.
9. Rewrote the Orbit Research and Landing Research Contracts to be more NASA Like.
10-. The parts have had a overhall pass and renamed. They reflect Real World Early Tech found on early Probes. Orbital Research Is now Ionization Chamber and LanderResearch is Mass Spectrometry Tube. (will be save friendly transfer)
11. Most other contracts that remain have been been made more Realistic in explanations.. Like historical missions.
[B]Version 1.11.0 Mission Controller For .90.[/B]

Please delete your whole MissionControllerEC folder before installing this update.

1. Added 2 new Historic Contracts Covering the United States TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) (3 Contracts)
  And the United States Mariner Program. Mariner 2 (Eve) Mariner 4 (Duna) Mariner 10 (Eve and Moho) and Renamed Mariner 11 and 12 (Voyager 1 To Jool System).
2. Added the ability to Add your own resources to the Station supply Contracts.  These Resources can be changed or added in the config file. What it looks like.
[CODE]
SupplyResourceList
	{
		Item = LiquidFuel
		Item = Oxidizer
		Item = MonoPropellant
		Item = XenonGas
		Item = Food
		Item = Water
		Item = Oxygen
		Item = Kibbal
