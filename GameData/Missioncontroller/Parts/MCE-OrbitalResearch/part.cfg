description = We at Malkuth Industries strive for the very best.  That is why we came up with the basic Ionization Chamber device.  An ionization chamber measures the charge from the number of ion pairs created within a gas caused by incident radiation. It consists of a gas-filled chamber with two electrodes; known as anode and cathode. The electrodes may be in the form of parallel plates (Parallel Plate Ionization Chambers: PPIC), or a cylinder arrangement with a coaxially located internal anode wire.
