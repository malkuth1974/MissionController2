description = Malkuth was sitting under a tree thinking about how great it would be if you could repair Space Vessels in Space.  At that point in time, if a space vessel broke in space you would be out of luck.  Well it dawned on him after opening his Mighty Kerbal Mouse Lunch box!  Why not put a Door on the vessel that can access the important Electronics!  And the Repair Panel was born.  Forged by the great Malkuth Industries Engineer HellFire Kerbal, this new panel revolutionized the space industry and many soon followed!
