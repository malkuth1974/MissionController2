description = After the success of our Ionization chamber malkuth industries needed a  new instrument that could help scientist find out the makeup of planetary bodies.  What we came up with was the Mass Spectrometry Tube.  A mass spectrum (plural spectra) is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical structures of molecules, such as peptides and other chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry works by ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged molecules or molecule fragments and measuring their mass-to-charge ratios.
